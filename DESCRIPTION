Description: SPIAT (Spatial Image Analysis of Tissues) is a suite of data processing, 
    quality control, visualization, data handling and data analysis tools for 
    multiplex immunohistochemistry. Converts INFORM or HALO images into a 
    SingleCellExperiment class. SPIAT includes novel algorithms for the 
    identification of cell clusters, cell margins and cell gradients, the 
    calculation of neighbourhood proportions, and algorithms for the prediction 
    of cell phenotypes in tissue images. SPIAT also includes speedy 
    implementations of the calculation of cell distances and detection of cell 
    communities.
